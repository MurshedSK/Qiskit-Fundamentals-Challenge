## 📓 Experience Report


Overall, the notebook was a great practical review of the Qiskit 2.0 SDK. The exercises for the Sampler and Estimator primitives were particularly helpful.

My experience running the "Qiskit Fundamentals" notebook was positive overall, and it served as an excellent practical review of the Qiskit 2.0 SDK.

I encountered a significant challenge when attempting Exercise 19, "Running on real IBM Quantum hardware." When I tried to save my credentials using QiskitRuntimeService.save_account(), my existing IBM API key and CRN (Cloud Resource Name) failed to authenticate.

To resolve this issue, I had to create an entirely new IBMid. With this new account, I set up a new IBM Cloud instance, generated a fresh API key and CRN, and these new credentials worked perfectly. After resolving the authentication, the rest of the notebook and the job submission to the real hardware executed smoothly.

## 🧑‍🏫 Mentorship Request

Regarding the offer for mentorship or guidance:


Yes, I would be very interested in mentorship or guidance to learn more about Qiskit. I am especially interested in error mitigation, error correction, and algorithm implementation.
